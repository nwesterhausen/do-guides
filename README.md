A couple simple articles on using Digital Ocean

## Steps 

1. Create a droplet with Debian 11
2. Choose an acceptable plan. Recommend one with at least 2GB memory.
3. Choose a geographically acceptable location (NY = east coast, SF = west coast)
4. Enable monitoring (no cost, but extra stats on droplet performance)
5. Select an ssh key (here's a [guide on creating an ssh key]() if needed)
6. Choose 1 droplet
7. Rename if you want
8. Enabling backups is optional, has an additional cost

Droplet will now be created. Then it will be time to login and install any programs you want.
